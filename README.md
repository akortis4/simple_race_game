# Simple Race Game

## Python 3.11

This is a simple survival race game built in python with pygame. The object of the game is to survive as long as possible on the track. The basis of this game was a racing game I had in on my TI-83 Plus back in high school. It was simple. The player would use the left and right arrows to move the character that represented a car left or righ to avoid the the edges of the track. The track was wide at first but then narrowed over time.
